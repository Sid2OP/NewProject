		The 2000-year old fort has been the site of many battles, with the Battle of Sinhagad (1670) being the most notable of all. The fort was named ‘Lion Fort’ (Sinhagad) to honor the sacrifice of Tanaji Malusare (right hand of Chhatrapati Shivaji) who lost his life while fighting the Mughals in the battle. The fort, built on the top of a hill, offers an amazing view of the lush greenery surrounding it. Pune Darwaza and Kalyan Darwaza are the two entrances to the fort, with the former being the main entry point for visitors. There are a few temples and a memorial built for Tanaji Malusare inside the fort. Click here to know places to visit with 100km<br>

       Although there is a motorable road till the entrance, trekking to it is preferred by many youngsters.

    Located around 4500 feet above sea level, Purandar Fort was the birthplace of Sambhaji, the son of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The fort is of great historical significance as it marks Shivaji’s rise against the Mughals and Bijapur Sultanate. However, Shivaji was not the only ruler of the Purandar Fort, as it was the Yadava dynasty which constructed it in the 11th century. <br>

    An hour-and-half drive amidst the picturesque Western Ghats range will take you to this huge hilltop fort. On reaching the fort, you will notice that the fort has been divided into two distinct levels – the upper level known as Ballekilla and the lower level known as the Machi. Both the upper and lower levels house temples dedicated to Lord Shiva and Purandareshwar, the fort’s patron deity.<br>

    Besides being a popular tourist spot, a part of the fort is used as the training academy of National Cadet Corps. The place is also a hotspot for paragliding and trekking, giving you another reason to come here.<br>

			Tikona Fort, meaning triangular fort, derives its name from its pyramidal shape. It is a major hill fort in the Maval region near Lonavala, built during the Silhara dynasty’s rule. Nestled in the lap of the Sahyadri Ranges, this 3500-feet high (altitude) hill fort has its colossal entrance as its major highlight. Besides this, it is also popular for its Trimbakeshwar Mahadev temple, seven water tanks, Satavahana-era caves, and a breathtaking view of Pawna Dam.<br>

           The nearest starting point for the hike to Tikona Fort is the parking area near Tikona Peth, the base village for the excursion. The trek is safe, and it will take you around an hour to reach the entrance of the fort. From here, the journey becomes a lot exciting as the steps to the top are very narrow. It is, therefore, advisable to avoid climbing the fort in large groups. <br>

Distance from Pune: Around 51 km via Paud Road
